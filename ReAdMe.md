MicroPoject 1 - Week 1

A Solar flare is the rapid release of a large amount of electromagnetic energy energy stored in the solar atmosphere. Solar flares are thought to occur when stored magnetic energy in the Sun's atmosphere accelerates charged particles in the surrounding plasma. During a flare, gas is heated to 10 to 20 million degrees Kelvin (K) and radiates soft X rays and longer-wavelength emission. Unable to penetrate the Earth's atmosphere, the X rays can only be detected from space. Reuven Ramaty High Energy Solar Spectroscopic Imager (RHESSI) is a NASA solar flare observatory, in its 6th mission in the Small Explorer program Its primary goal is to explore the physics of particle acceleration, energy release in solar flares and frequency of those. This new approach will enable researchers to find out where these particles are accelerated and to what energies. Such information will advance understanding of the fundamental high-energy processes at the core of the solar flare problem. The only instrument on board is an imaging spectrometer with the ability to obtain high fidelity color movies of solar flares in X rays and gamma rays. It uses two new complementary technologies: fine grids to modulate the solar radiation, and germanium detectors to measure the energy of each photon very precisely.
